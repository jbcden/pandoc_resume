<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I am a Rails developer with 4 years of experience, including experience with MySQL, Javascript, CSS and React.</p>
<p>I actively advocate using Object Oriented Design principles to make code cleaner and more extensible while also drawing inspiration from functional languages like Elixir and Haskell. I also have experience working on performance improvements and especially enjoy working on improving slow database queries.</p>
<p>Most of my side projects are small kata exercises in various languages. I typically use exercism.io or go over Advent of Code exercises to explore new ways to approach problems.</p>

<dd><strong>Reallyenglish</strong>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Skills used:</em> Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes</p>
<p><em>Role overview:</em> Helped lead development of the new version of the Reallyenglish management system. Worked with other teams in the company to coordinate development of new features as well as working to improve performance of key parts of the application.</p>
<p><em>Interesting challenges:</em> Certain parts of the application were initially implemented in an inefficient manner to allow for quicker prototyping. As we have begun onboarding new customers onto the new version of the application we have started to explore ways to improve the performance of this system by looking to best practices in Ruby, Rails and database design.</p>

<p><em>Skills used:</em> Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Sinatra, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Ansible</p>
<p><em>Role overview:</em> Helped develop and maintain API endpoints for the Pocket Geek suite of applications. Built out new services to help integrate our applications with new clients.</p>
<p><em>Interesting challenges:</em> The database started with very few indexes or foreign key constraints. As the database grew, we had increasing problems with slow performance and inconsistent data. We researched and implemented best practices in database design to solve these problems.</p>
