Summary
-------

I am a Rails developer with 4 years of experience, including experience with
MySQL, Javascript, CSS and React.

I actively advocate using Object Oriented Design principles to make code cleaner
and more extensible while also drawing inspiration from functional languages
like Elixir and Haskell. I also have experience working on performance improvements
and especially enjoy working on improving slow database queries.

Most of my side projects are small kata exercises in various languages. I typically
use exercism.io or go over Advent of Code exercises to explore new ways to
approach problems.

Experience
----------

5/2018-Present
:   **Reallyenglish**

*Skills used:* Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PostgreSQL,
Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes

*Role overview:* Helped lead development of the new version of the
Reallyenglish management system. Worked with other teams in the company to
coordinate development of new features as well as working to improve performance
of key parts of the application.

*Interesting challenges:* Certain parts of the application were initially
implemented in an inefficient manner to allow for quicker prototyping. As
we have begun onboarding new customers onto the new version of the application
we have started to explore ways to improve the performance of this system by
looking to best practices in Ruby, Rails and database design.


6/2015-4/2018
:   **Mobile Defense/Assurant Inc.**

> **Mobile Defense was acquired by Assurant in May of 2016.**

*Skills used:* Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Sinatra, MySQL, PostgreSQL and  Ansible

*Role overview:* Helped develop and maintain API endpoints for the Pocket Geek
suite of applications. Built out new services to help integrate our applications
with new clients.

*Interesting challenges:* The database started with very few indexes or foreign key
constraints. As the database grew, we had increasing problems with slow
performance and inconsistent data. We researched and implemented best
practices in database design to solve these problems.


9/2014-5/2015
:   **Student System Administrator,  
    Oberlin Center for Technologically Enhanced Teaching:**

*Skills used:* Bash scripting, virtualization, Ruby

*Role overview:* Helped maintain existing servers. Wrote software to
make their use more efficient and effective through the automation of common tasks
with scripts. Created new VMs to test new software
and environments (multiple Unix-based systems):

*Interesting challenges:* Created scripts to automate common processes on all
Unix machines in a computer lab.

:   **Software Developer and ID Card Programmer,  
    Oberlin College Office of Residential Education:**

*Skills used:* Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Bash scripting, Elixir

*Role overview:* Developed software for the Residential Education Office.

faculty and staff ID card usage, integrating this information into web-based
applications.
