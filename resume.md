Summary
-------

I am a Rails developer with 4 years of experience, including experience with
MySQL, Javascript, CSS and React.

I actively advocate using Object Oriented Design principles to make code cleaner
and more extensible while also drawing inspiration from functional languages
like Elixir and Haskell. I also have experience working on performance improvements
and especially enjoy working on improving slow database queries.

Most of my side projects are small kata exercises in various languages. I typically
use exercism.io or go over Advent of Code exercises to explore new ways to
approach problems.

suite of applications. Built out new services to help integrate our applications
with new clients.

*Interesting challenges:* The database started with very few indexes or foreign key

performance and inconsistent data. We researched and implemented best
practices in database design to solve these problems.
